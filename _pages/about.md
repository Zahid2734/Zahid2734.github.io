I am Zahidur Talukder, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington, under the supervision of <a href="https://crystal.uta.edu/~mislam/">Dr. Mohammad Atiqul Islam</a>. I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2018, followed by an MBA from the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) at the University of Dhaka. I commenced my Ph.D. journey in the Fall of 2019.

My research is centered on the theoretical, empirical, and security aspects of algorithms and machine learning. Specifically, I focus on federated learning, where I have been working on efficient data and client handling. My contributions include developing self-regulating clients that can manage data-level errors and innovating new aggregation techniques for servers in federated learning environments.

I am deeply passionate about the applications of machine learning and algorithms, striving to create secure and efficient solutions. My work aims to address significant challenges in data privacy, AI sustainability, and fairness in heterogeneous federated learning systems. As a recognized Machine Learning and Systems Rising Star of 2024, I am dedicated to advancing the field and making impactful contributions.
